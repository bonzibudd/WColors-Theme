# WColors-Theme
UX theme for Windows 10 using improvements to the High Contrast theme. Supports custom color schemes, including dark and light.

## Installation
Make sure you have a theme patcher, such as [UltraUxThemePatcher](https://mhoefs.eu/software_uxtheme.php?ref=syssel&lang=en). This will allow Windows to use the custom resources.

To install the theme, copy the extracted contents of the latest release (excluding the parent folder) to C:\Windows\Resources\Theme. You should now be able to double-click the .theme files in order to apply them. 

## Suggestions

Since this theme uses High Contrast resources, there are some limitations to the user interface. Here are some changes you can make to improve the interface:
 - Install [Open-Shell Menu](https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu) and enable Taskbar customization. Set taskbar to opaque and use a custom texture (can be blank). Additionally, you can disable the Start Menu in the "Controls" tab and instead use the standard Windows menu if you choose.
 - Install 7+ Taskbar Tweaker to disable the "Show Desktop" button. You can also change other settings, like Taskbar button size.
 
 These tweaks may not be necessary in the future as more changes to the skin are added.
