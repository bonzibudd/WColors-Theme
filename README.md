# WColors-Theme
UX theme for Windows 10 using improvements to the High Contrast theme. Supports custom color schemes, including dark and light.

## Installation
Make sure you have a theme patcher, such as [UltraUxThemePatcher](https://mhoefs.eu/software_uxtheme.php?ref=syssel&lang=en). This will allow Windows to use the custom resources.

To install the theme, copy the extracted contents of the latest release (excluding the parent folder) to C:\Windows\Resources\Theme. You should now be able to double-click the .theme files in order to apply them.
